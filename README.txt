The Geomark Web Service allows you to create and share geographic areas of interest over the web in a variety of formats and coordinate systems. This service is especially helpful when you need to share an area of interest with people who require that the data be in a different format, or they use different mapping software.

If you are considering submitting an application for Crown resources navigate to the FrontCounterBC Discovery Tool which also uses this service to define the area that you are interested in for your proposed application.
